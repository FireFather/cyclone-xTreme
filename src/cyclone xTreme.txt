General
-------
Cyclone xTreme is a very strong UCI chess engine based on Fruit 2.1,
Toga II 14beta5c, Grapefruit 1.0, Toga CMLX 145e4, and Cyclone 3.4 that plays
Fischer Random Chess (also known as Chess 960).

This release comes with an Intel compiled PGO Windows executable and Windows
compatible source code.

Description:
---------------------------------
Cyclone xTreme plays normal chess as well as Fischer Random Chess (Chess 960)
To play Fischer Random, enable UCI option UCI_Chess960

Cyclone xTreme uses a configuration file (Cyclone.cfg) to obtain more than 140
eval, material, and search parameters.

The program will write a default configuration file...just type 'default'
at the command prompt....the chess engine should play very strong utilizing
this default configuration.

Want to experiment? Roll the dice, try your luck by typing 'random' at the
command prompt.  A new Cyclone.cfg will be written using random values.
(these values are reasonable and within a set range, yet are relatively broad
in scope, the possibilities are endless...)

To widen or narrow the random range of each parameter requires editing the
source code.

WARNING: any existing Cyclone.cfg file that may exist in the current
directory will be overwritten. (if you have a good one, please save it
in another location before generating a new Cyclone.cfg file.)

WARNING: using a random Cyclone.cfg file will very likely weaken the
engine significantly. this option is provided for experimental tuning
and testing (and most of all fun and amusement!) purposes only.

The Cyclone.cfg file can also be manually edited...using any (plain text)
word processor...Wordpad, Notepad, vi, etc.
